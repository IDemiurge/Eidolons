ok, so I am working with DC "subclasses" now, the question is - what should I add to CORE and what - to DC. And how to avoid
confusion! The whole point is that CORE really is generically reusable, so the basics are coded there, right?... 

what will be better for now - to try and work on both (first I will also need to actually make DC subclass CORE...)
OR 
just work on DC stuff and then see when the time is right to extract the generic part or just rework all that...
Naturally, let's start smalL! DC version is just as good! 


-----------------

CORE element package - is it about time to straighten it up? 
real G-Engine - when will I need it? 


test graphics - what is crucial?

RULE LIBS - ??? test rules ?

multiplayer testing preparations 

when will i consider local test accomplished?
- switch turns and make battle comprehensively! 
	* deal dmg, defend, die... 


---------------------


I rather disheartening failure with damned layers, but I have to move on.

so, rules or graphics? Let's make a small step on one of those directions!
rules will also include revising and reworking some core classes... or designing them anew!

graphics could benefit from simplification of G_comp and Builder systems

but the simplest now would be to continue adding stuff - panels etc
and it is needed too
