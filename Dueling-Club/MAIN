Overview:
Rule libraries on top of C-Engine 


Brand new ideas:
browser version



Definitely must-have: 
damage types 
standard effects
battlefield
mercenaries/summoned
classes and training coursed for chars
static and usable items 
toughness/endurance 
*Rule: regen toughness at the start of each turn
Turns - one side at a time


QUESTIONS:
Spell rules - spellbook, casting, costs; Impl - effects? 
setting - wizardry only? 
Guilds/langs


Graphics - panels? objComponents? 


------------------

the very first version - what will it feature?
depending on that, I will see what are the requirements for arcane vault, c-engine and g-engine
i could just make it raw unit fight - similar to Berserker
