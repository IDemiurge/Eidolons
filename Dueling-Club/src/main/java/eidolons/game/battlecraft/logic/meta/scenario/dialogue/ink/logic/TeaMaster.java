/**
 * Created by JustMe on 2/14/2017.
 *
 * what are the main gears of this mechanic?
 *
 * 1) We enter into conversation and see some limited info about the NPC - perhaps its mood, profession,
 * approx. Influence levels...
 * 2) We can use the Gift to see more - their Traits (tags),
 * 3)
 *
 * conversation is build from a number of branches
 * for instance, an Innkeep will have
 * > rumors
 * > quests
 * > influence
 *
 * influence options will be broad enough:
 * perhaps they could work w/o words -
 * [boast]
 * [threaten]
 * [joke]
 * (some 5 more)
 *
 * the reaction will first be mathematical...
 *
 * Really? You handled all five of them, wow, my old man could do seven any day of the week!
 * Piss off...
 *
 *
 * most responses have a tag of 'type'
 *
