prototype for I 
debug/control panel
thru it, test/design key functions for C/G. 
start with: 
listeners 
hotseat kill/move game - switch turns
game - gamestate (obj man., 
battlefield graphics (basic)





AV for testing? just edit types and write to xml! 

What i

**********************
	I - Testable 
**********************

Connect for duel
exchange party files (doesn't have to by anything more than the character type)
get to battlefield, where parties are initialized 
make turns - move units, then pass

=================>>> Requirements:

C-Engine
ObjType basics - initialize, set/get/modifyVal, change state, ... 
DC_Game logic - turns, objects, action commands 
----------------------
G-Engine
battlefield
objComponents with listeners and basic functions - move, kill, ..
 
----------------------
DC:
socket connection
data transmission
 *note - these should actually be implemented in CORE!!! (or "SoE-Net"?)
 ? what could serve as basic test for these ? 
 ? could/should I try and make use of old code ? 
 
----------------------

Tests
check conditions

????????? what first ???????????
From end - core functions + graphical representation
e.g. - local testing:
create a type from xml, display its component properly
