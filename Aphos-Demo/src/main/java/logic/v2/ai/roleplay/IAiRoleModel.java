 * Created by Alexander on 1/21/2023
 * Encapsulates information about the static/default tendencies of a SingleAi
 * Ideally, should provide a set of functions whose results are in a way pre-trained so they depend on
 * many parameters but don't require manual coding
 *
 * Most basic -
 * Discipline / restraint - dealing with impulses
 * Pride - ‘resist’ command
 * Intelligence - planning
