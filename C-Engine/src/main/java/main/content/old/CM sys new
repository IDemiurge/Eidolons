what is "content"?

in the end, it will be xml from which to build 
parameter/property/type lists - maps
to be used when reading concrete xml - 

no, those are not *needed* to read - xml already tells what params/props/types
there are...

ok, for Core to work with certain Types
parse abilities



params/props - what do they have? Tags, 


example: list of params for DC units
HP
dmg

xml would look like

units
zombie 
params
attr "hp" = 10,
...
/params

props
attr "race" = "undead",
/props

where is this format described? only in read method? Or enforced 
yes, above all the reading method must be dictated by desired format and
functionality - groups, map construction, ...

specifics for params/props



??? abilities - same for all games???
