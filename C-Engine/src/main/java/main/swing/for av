in what way is G used? by Builders? yes, they would have just imperative ways of 
using G classes. But what is the advantage over using standard classes? 
Kind of more control and separation of concerns, more encapsulation and potential for
future re-use. 
Good.

data is taken from C engine, but it will be first made into Strings, then passed
to G classes. 

I decided that I will try to use G Engine, but I won't cross the line of reason
